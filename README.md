# A-Star-Algorithm
Implemented A* Alg with different data structures (array, min-heap, multi-stack heap) based on a maze GUI.
Those data structures are mainly used for the open list of A*.
The system can compare performances of those data structures with different factors, such as the size of the map, the dense of obstacles on the map, etc.
Multi-stack heap is a heap but each of its node is a stack-based container.
Go to src/Main.class and run the file to interact with the system.
